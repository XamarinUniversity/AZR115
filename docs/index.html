        <h2>Building an Azure Mobile App Client (AZR115)</h2>
<p>Suppose you have your data stored in the Azure cloud and are coding Xamarin apps to show the data to clients on multiple platforms. You could use HttpClient to transfer JSON-encoded data and a serializer to convert between JSON and your model objects. This works but is tedious to implement. A better option is the Azure client SDK because it simplifies basic CRUD operations and offers advanced features such as offline caching. This course shows you how to use MobileServiceClient from the Azure SDK to work with your Azure data tables. You will consume data from an Azure service, add support for offline caching and synchronization, and manage data conflicts when they arise.</p>
<p>This class assumes you have already setup an Azure account and have a basic knowledge of the Azure management portal.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="parts/part1.html">Exercise goals</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you will modify an existing Xamarin.Forms application to add support for Azure mobile app service. </p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part2.html">Exercise goals</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you will continue to develop the <strong>CastMyVote</strong> Xamarin.Forms application. You will modify the data structures used by the application to reflect the shape of the service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part3.html">Exercise goals</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you will continue modifying the <strong>CastMyVote</strong> Xamarin.Forms to add support for querying and updating our created tables in the Azure service we created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part4.html">Exercise goals</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you will continue modifying the <strong>CastMyVote</strong> Xamarin.Forms application to add support for offline caching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part5.html">Exercise goals</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you will complete your offline caching logic by adding code to synchronize the local database with the remote database on Azure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part6.html">Exercise goals</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you will add conflict resolution support to your client so that you can detect when records are changed by multiple clients.</p>
